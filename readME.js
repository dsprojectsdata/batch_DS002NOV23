/*

    Hooks -> Hooks in react are special function which have superpowers like storing data in memory/state, doing stuff at the right time (useEffect)

    useState Syntax =>
    const [stateVariable, setStateVariable] = useState(initialValue);

    - Whenever we change anything in hook/useState, react rerender that component
    - Rerender work because of Fiber algorithm/ reconciliation
